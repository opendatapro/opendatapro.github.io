# Why care about open data?

Open data isn’t just a concept of offering and using free data, but rather a source of opportunity. It’s a chance to expand your business, grow your brand beyond it’s limits, a chance to become more than a data/service/product provider.

Whether you have zero or incredible amounts of data, odds are you can benefit.

Open data enables you to be transparent and build genuine trust. It's an opportunity to show you’re serious and reliable, a way to develop relationships, find trustworthy partners, improve your business, steer it and get new revenue streams. It's a way to become a market leader.
