# What makes open data open?

## Licence

The most crucial part of every open data offering is the licence. This is the point where the giving happens. It’s what separates an “ordinary” data source from an open data source.

The licence for open data must not limit it’s use unless for:
- requiring attribution
- privacy of personal data
- security

This also means that open data is provided for free.

(Discussing licensing details with a legal advisor is always a good idea.)

## Accessibility

Allowing access to data (via licence) is useless, unless there’s a reasonable way to consume it. The easier it is to understand and (re)use it, the better the accessibility.

### Human accessibility

While web accessibility deals mostly with ensuring people with disabilities are able to use and enjoy the web, it’s worth taking it a step further. Presenting data in a well designed way will further boost it’s usefulness. This means making it quickly understood, easy to navigate and providing an overall positive user experience.

In regards to “human accessibility” you should look into who might benefit from this data the most and tailor the experience to your target audience.

For example, let’s imagine you provide open data on university programs. Potential students could benefit greatly from reviewing this insight, however they might not be able to understand and utilise it, due to complicated statistical terms and/or complex charts.

Here’s just a few additional things to consider in any project:
- internet access and speed of the internet connection
- is data being consumed via PC, mobile devices or elsewhere, such as smart TVs
- how well does the audience understand the topic
- how well do they understand statistics
- etc.

Keep in mind that, if data is difficult or impossible to access, it’s a waste of resources to even provide it.

### Machine accessibility

In the context of open data, machine accessibility means how easy it is for data to be understood by machines and how easy it is for developers to build solutions on top of it.

While there are a few ways to measure (parts of) machine accessibility, this remains a very broad topic covering:
- formats
- linking of data
- semantic markup
- stability
- support for developers
- etc.

The best way to achieve machine accessibility is to provide a well documented, quality API.

A great API not only makes (re)using data possible, but by extensions helps cover much of the human accessibility issues (other can build better solutions for each specific use case).

While providing a high grade open data source can be challenging, doing so, combined with the right strategic approach, could mean unlocking great potential for everyone involved, including your business.
