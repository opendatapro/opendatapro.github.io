# How to boost the impact of your research paper with open data?
Enthusiastic, highly qualified people are publishing vast amounts of research each month. The sad truth is it’s far under-utilised or worse, no one even cares about your research.

Luckily, open data can help you make your work count by unleashing additional value for you (the author), your employer, other researchers and ultimately everyone who benefits from advances in your field.

## Validation

Papers that can be rechecked (since the data is open) are inherently more trustworthy and hold greater weight due to being under public scrutiny.

Providing open data alongside your research gives it integrity. Most papers drone on about the methodology used, why was it chosen, how it was implemented, etc. You are much better off providing the factual input you gathered. This makes your work instantly transparent. Anyone can recalculate, reanalyse and reinterpret your data to provide further proof of concept. If they challenge your idea, great! They are giving you a topic for your next paper.

By pinpointing pain points in such a public manner, you are far more likely to discover issues either with the topic or your work. Sometimes it may be as simple as a need for things to be explained differently, other times a shift might be necessary. In any case, you are getting crucial constructive feedback.

## Better understanding

Context is a common issue with research. “Is the paper useful for explaining my reasoning?”, “Is this case-study applicable to my situation?”, “Am I right to use the conclusions from this research in my work?” are some of the questions readers have when looking for research made in a given field.

When you open up data that was used in your research you allow the reader to make an informed decision whether your work is relevant to them. It’s about providing context. The better the understanding of inputs, the better the understanding of your work and conclusions.

Open data also helps with comparing your work to work done by others. Again, making it easier to see where it fits and where it stands out in relation to the volume of work already available on the topic.

The actual information gathered gives indirect insight in your work process. What data is gathered and how it formatted is often telling of your workflow. It’s a great way to find collaborators, get tips on improving the way you work and by extension improve your output.

## Attribution and reuse

Having your research mean something is often measured by the number of quotes and how well your work echoes. Open data can help you with that. How you ask? It will make your work double up as a data source.

Large amounts of data are gathered each year by individual researchers who are publishing papers, yet most of it is never (re)used. All of that work ends up being stuck in a single or a few research papers. You’ve already put in the sweat, effort and time. Now, let data work for you. Let it bring you additional attributions, let it be reused — let it matter.

## Conclusion

Basically giving away your hard earned data may seem a bit intimidating or even counterintuitive at first. The thing to remember though, is that making your research data open makes it far more valuable, trustworthy and relevant.
