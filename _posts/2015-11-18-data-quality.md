# Open data as a way to improve data quality

Using secondary (open) data sources as well as opening the data you collected yourself can improve the quality of data you have at your disposal. 

By using open data sources we can avoid or reduce the effect of any errors that may have occurred while data was being collected or in the process of publishing data. Some of these irregularities can be as simple as syntactical oversight, while others of course are more complex. Shortcomings arising from tools (software, hardware and/or any other tools) used to collect and store the data can be difficult to discover early on. What is more, these lapses can soon become costly to remedy as the amount of data increases. 

Similarly, issues with methodology (e.g. observer bias) are perhaps even more difficult to overcome, yet open data offers us a chance to note or even fix related shortcomings.

Using multiple data sources lends itself to greater objectivity, reliability and (if the datasets are comparable) enables us to do re-validation of the collected values. In this sense, any open dataset, regardless of itâ€™s size can be valuable.

Making data you collected yourself open data increases the chances of discovering errors. As there are potentially many more, diverse users of the given dataset, the chances of finding any issues increases and with it, the chance to improve the quality of your data.

Besides the many other benefits open data provides, whether you are consuming or providing it, it also paves the way to improving the quality of data itself.
