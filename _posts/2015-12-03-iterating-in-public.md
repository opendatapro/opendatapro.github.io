# Open data and the fear of iterating in public

Iterating in public can be daunting. Not only are you under the usual pressure of work, but by making your work public you open it up for review. Perhaps you feel it’s not finished, it needs more tweaking, more polish. 

The fear of putting something out there is present with almost every project, more so if you’re a perfectionist. Working on an open project such as open data makes it even worse, since you’re actually making it far more open than you would a conventional piece of work.

However, in most cases, there is no way around. You have to make it open and the sooner, the better.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t care about your work, I am simply saying that you should seek out feedback, not worry about perfection, most projects can’t wait to be perfect and will improve in leaps if public.

The following list helps me when I’m feeling doubts about iterating in public. I try to keep in mind that **most of the time**:

- no one cares about your work and by making it public you can gauge interest sooner

- speed trumps perfection

- no one cares if you fail

- no one remembers your failure

- no one spend more time thinking about your failures than you

- failing makes a good story

- failing is a valid way to learn 

- if you care about failing, you will put in more effort

- failing *to do* is worse than failing *at something*

- failing completely is unlikely, which means you did something well, which means you just found what you should probably be doing more of
