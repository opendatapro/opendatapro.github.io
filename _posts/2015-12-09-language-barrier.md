# Does your open data have language barriers?

## Currently used language

When we think of language we usually think of foreign languages and rarely about the currently used language. Here are a few questions and solutions to get you started.

### Are you using (less known) acronyms?
Acronyms are useful for reducing repetitive sets of words, however they can be baffling to your reader if used incorrectly. A good practice when using acronyms is to first write the long versions and note the acronym. 
A bit more elegant version of this is to use a note next to the acronym when it was first used. The note should provide the long version an if it makes sense a short explanation.

### Are you using jargon?
Try to avoid the use of jargon or at the very least link to a simple explanation. If you can’t refrain from using jargon than try providing additional explanation via a note.

Not sure if something is jargon? Ask someone who knows nothing about the topic if they understand the given phrase. If two or more people understand the phrase, than it is probably not jargon or has spilled over into common knowledge.

### Could your data be worded any simpler?
Explaining the terminology may seem redundant, but it’s usually one of the cheapest and simplest ways to increase the value of a dataset. To avoid overhead, you can simply link to existing definitions.

## Should you translate to a foreign language
Think about who can benefit from your data. Do the people that could benefit the most speak the language under which the data is published? If not, than the data you’re providing isn’t all that open (at least not to this group). Hopefully though at least a subset of that audience does speak your language of choice. 

It is important to try to provide the data in at least on of the most widespread languages in the world. Also worth noting is that while some languages are spoken by a large number of people, those people are heavily concentrated in a single geographical area, so picking that particular language, will influence the diversity of your audience.

Translating into additional languages does come at a cost, there are initial costs, maintenance costs and of course you have to be careful about different formatting. All of this, means resources that could go toward improving your dataset, either in quality or quantity, go into translating. Therefor, you should always consider whether to actually provide additional translations. Keep in mind that since the data is open, other can translate it and provide versions in additional languages.
