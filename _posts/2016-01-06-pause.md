# Opendatapro.com is taking a break

Since October I have been posting every Wednesday about open data. While I would still like to continue with this pace, I don’t think it would be even near up to par and it’s my fault. You see, when I started _Open data pro_, I did so with little to no preparation. All I had, was a list of topic ideas and off I went writing and building the site, all ad-hoc.

Initially, this approach seemed to work fine, however soon there were issues. Since I haven’t prepared any articles in advance, the limited time I had to work on this project meant I wasn’t able to put any effort into polishing or promoting content.

I know I could have done better. On the other hand, I could have done nothing; much like with countless projects which are stuck, permanently on hold. I am glad I did not wait for perfection, but rather decided to [iterate in public][1]. I am proud of the results. For 3 months I managed to write a post each week and let me tell you, writing regularly with a few hours of time to spare (at most) is far more difficult than it seems. 

All in all I am glad I started _Open data pro_ and the lessons I learned along the way. For now however, I have to take a pause. Hopefully I will have the time and resources to work on this project again in future, in the meantime enjoy the open data out there and consider being a provider.
